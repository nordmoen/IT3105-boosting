\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
As we stated what seems to be the biggest problem with our \adaboost{}
algorithm seems to be the problem that several classifiers "vote" in cases where
they should not, but because that classifier is good in the general case it will
over turn the "vote" of a classifier that is specialized. The problem could be
due to several different things, it might be the way weights are calculated, it
might be the way classifiers are given a weight and it might be down to the fact
that all classifiers see all training instances even though they should
specialize.
