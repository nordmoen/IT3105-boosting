\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}
One important thing we found when examining the results were that the datasets 
are very important for the effect the boosting algorithm has. If a dataset has 
a low number of instances and/or a very heavily skewed proportion of 
instance-classes boosting, at least using our implementation of Naive Bayesian 
and Decision Tree Classifiers is not very effective.
Another important factor for the effect of boosting is the depth of the 
decision trees the DTC is allowed to construct, if these are deep enough to 
allow a dataset to be split on all of its attributes it will construct 
over-fitted trees that only have a marginal improvement from boosting in the 
cases were the data is ambiguous or unknown.
